# cou

Cou is a simple, statically typed programming language

## Instructions

In project directory, run
```
./cou <program-file-name>
```

## Syntax

### Types

Cou supports the following types

*num* : Represents a number, either an integer or float

*bool* : Represents a boolean, denoted as either 'true' or 'false'

*str* : Represents a string. In cou, strings are delimited by single quotes, ie, ```'hello world'``` is acceptable, but ```"hello world"``` is not.

*nil* : A type to represent nothing, like ```null``` in Java or ```None``` in Python. The keyword used to represent a *nil* type object is ```nothing```

*arr* : Represents an array. In cou, arrays do not have an enforced typing. They are only initialized using a size parameter. For example, ```arr[5]``` will initialize an array with five elements. Each element will assume a ```nothing``` value by default.
Array elements are accessed in typical fashion, ie, for an given an array named a with 3 elements, ```a[2]``` will access the third element in a.

### Variables

Since cou is statically typed, each variable must have a specified type when it is declared. The syntax for a variable declaration is *identifer* : *type*.

Cou does not support variable declaration without assignment, so when a variable is declared it must also be assigned a value. For example, ```s: str;``` is not a valid expression, and will cause a parser error.

Below are some valid examples of variable declaration in cou.

```
integer: num = 5; # Creates a number with the value '5'
```

```
b: bool = true; # Creates a 'true' valued boolean
```

```
hello: str = 'hello world'; # Creates a variable 'hello' that stores the string hello world.
```

```
five: arr = arr[5]; # Creates an array with five elements
```

```
nada: nil = nothing; # Creates a 'nil' variable, assigning it 'nothing'
```

## Grammar

Cou currently has the following language constructs

(a bit outdated)
### number
#### [0-9]+ | [0-9]* [\.] [0-9]+

Represents an integer or real number

### bool
#### true | false

Represents a boolean

### str
#### ' [.]* '

Represents a string (delimited by ')

### id
#### [[a-z]|[A-Z]| _ ]+

Represents an identifier used for variables/function declarations

### begin
#### \{

Represents the beginning of a function

### end
#### \}

Represents the end of a function

### separator
#### ;

Represents a seprator of lines of code

### type
#### int | real | bool | str

Represents a valid type in cou (either an int or real)

### variable
#### id

Represents a variable with an identifier

### variable_declaration
#### variable [:] type

Represents a variable declaration

### operand
#### number | (expression) | [+|-] operand | variable

Represents an object that can be operated on. (~ is a unary operator for the floor function)

### term
#### operand [\*|/|%/] operand)*

Represents a term, ie, a grouping of multiplication operations done on operands (~/ is integer division)

### expression
#### term [[+|-] term]*

Represents an expression, ie, a grouping of addition operations done on terms

### empty
####

Represents an empty statement

### assignment statement
#### [variable | variable_declaration] [=] expression

Represents an assignment statement, where a variable is assigned the result of san expression

### statement
#### assignment_statement separator | empty separator | expression

Represents a general statement of code

### program
#### statement* eof

Represents a program, ie, a block of statements with the end of file terminating it

## Built in functions

### say
#### Usage : say arg;

Prints the string representation of an argument (parentheses optional)
